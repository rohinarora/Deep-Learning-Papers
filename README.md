# Deep-Learning-Papers

This repo has pointers to papers i found interesting (computer vision, neural network compression etc). Also has links to my reimplementation of some of the papers


## Neural Network Compression


* [Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference](./notes/pcnnfrefi.md)  [[arXiv](https://https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06440)]
