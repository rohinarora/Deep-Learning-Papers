# Deep-Learning-Papers

This repo has notes and critiques of papers i found interesting (computer vision, neural network compression etc). Also has links to my reimplementation [:white_check_mark:] of some of the papers.


## Neural Network Compression

* [Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference](./main/pcnnfrefi.md)  [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06440)] :white_check_mark:
* [Neural Network Compression Meta/Trends](./main/meta_nn_compression.md)

#### Dealing with sparsity  
* [README](./main/sparsity.md)

## Computer Vision
* EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks
* Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy: FixEfficientNet
* [Computer Vision Meta/Trends](./main/meta_cv.md)
