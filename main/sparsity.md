  * https://developer.nvidia.com/cusparse
  * set of basic linear algebra subroutines for handling sparse matrices on NVIDIA GPUs
* cuSOLVER
  * https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html
  * cuSolver library is a high-level package based on the cuBLAS and cuSPARSE libraries
  * CUDA sparse matix library
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31840341/solving-general-sparse-linear-systems-in-cuda
    * Supports Â solving general sparse linear systems in CUDA
* Tiramisu Compiler
  * http://tiramisu-compiler.org/
  * Polyhedral compiler for dense and sparse deep learning. Provides a simple C++ API for expressing algorithms and how these algorithms should be optimized by the compiler
  * Tiramisu uses the extended polyhedral model internally while TVM and Halide use intervals. This allows Tiramisu to naturally express many code patterns and transformations that are difficult to express in TVM and Halide. http://tiramisu-compiler.org/Comparison.html
